# What Christmas Eve is It?

## Created by Aidan Comi
I was joking with a friend that it was Christmas Eve Eve Eve on December 22nd and I decide it would be a good test project to learn HTML and JS. This was coded in 1-2 hours using MANY tutorials and the code is very sloppy with no comments. Hopefully I'll be able to clean it up over time, but it was a fun project!
